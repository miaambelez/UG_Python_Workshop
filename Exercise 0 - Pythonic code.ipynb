    "PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal #8. It's essentially a set of rules and guidelines for formatting Python code. Adhering to PEP 8 helps make your code more readable and maintainable, not just for you but for others who may work on your code in the future. Some key aspects include naming conventions, indentation, line spacing, and avoiding overly complex expressions. Think of it as the etiquette for writing Python code, ensuring that it's clean, easy to read, and aesthetically pleasing.\n",

Once defined, a function can be called anywhere in your code by its name, allowing for cleaner, more organized, and efficient programming.

    "### Decorator functions\n",
    "A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as an argument, extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it, and returns the modified function, providing a flexible and reusable way to augment function functionality. Decorators are useful because they allow for the extension and modification of function behavior in a clean, readable, and maintainable way. They enable code reuse, reduce redundancy, and can add functionality to existing functions or methods without altering their core logic. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where you want to apply the same piece of code, like logging, authorization, or performance timing, across multiple functions or methods, thus adhering to the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle. By separating concerns, decorators enhance code modularity and clarity, making it easier to manage and extend.\n",

    "In the example below, we create wrapper function called log_execution, which prints information for logging info in execution of the function. You implement a decorator with an @ statement by placing it directly above a function definition, followed by the decorator function name, to automatically wrap and modify the behavior of the function it decorates."
